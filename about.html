        <h3>Where I Come From</h3>
        <p>
          I am from Lahore, Pakistan, a city full of culture, spirit, and history. I grew up in a home filled with love,
          support, and warmth, where curiosity was always welcomed and encouraged. Studying in Canada was always a dream
          for me, but moving away from my family, my comfort, and everything familiar was a big choice. It has taught me
          independence in ways I could never have imagined. It wasn’t easy, new culture, new challenges, and moments of
          doubt but every challenge made me stronger, confident, and more grateful for where I come from. Lahore will
          always be a part of who I am, but Canada has allowed me to discover who I can become and the possibilities I
          want to chase next.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">My Strength and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          My greatest inspirations and the biggest sources of strength in my life are my parents. My mom and dad are the
          reason who I am today, and everything I have achieved comes from the way they raised me. I was born into a
          culture where girls aren’t always raised to be independent, but my father never made me feel limited. He
          believed in me more than anyone, and he was the one who gave me wings to dream bigger and to explore. My
          mother is the person who shaped my values and taught me what strength, patience, and
          responsibility truly look like. She showed me that independence is something you earn through courage,
          kindness, and hard work.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          My parents have always been my best friends and my source of guidance. They taught me that success isn’t only
          about chasing goals, it’s about living with integrity and purpose. They have shown me what truly matters in
          life, and I hope I can become even a fraction of the strong, hardworking, and loving people they are and
          someday give them back even a little of the love they have given me.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
        <p>
          Since childhood, I’ve always had a curious mind and a desire to contribute to my community in a meaningful
          way. As I grew older, I discovered that technology wasn’t just interesting, it was powerful. Computer Science
          became the path that connected my curiosity with my purpose. With time, I realized that this field allows me
          to solve real problems, think creatively, and turn ideas into something useful.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Technology challenges me to think deeper and build solutions that actually matter. What I love most is that
          one
          line of code or one idea can positively impact someone, somewhere. And knowing that I can be part of something
          that creates change is what keeps me excited about the future.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Why York Felt Right For Me</h3>
        <p>
          I chose York’s Lassonde School of Engineering because it offers a diverse, innovative, and collaborative
          learning environment. I wanted a place that would challenge both my analytical and creative thinking, and
          Lassonde felt like the right space for that balance. The community here encourages exploration, curiosity, and
          real impact, not just academic achievement. York gives me the opportunity to grow not only as a student, but
          as
          a person shaping my own path in the world.
