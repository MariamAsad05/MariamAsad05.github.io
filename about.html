        <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
        <p>
          I was born in Pakistan, a place full of culture and strength, but where opportunities in STEM, especially for
          girls, are limited. I always dreamed of studying computer science and being able to build real solutions with
          technology. Moving abroad opened that door for me. It gave me independence and showed me that challenges can
          actually become turning points.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
          I chose York’s Lassonde School of Engineering because of its diverse, innovative environment, and because I
          wanted a space that would push both my analytical and creative skills. Computer Science felt like the right
          path for me something that lets me solve meaningful problems and think beyond what already exists. At the end
          of the day, my motivation comes from a genuine love for learning, exploring ideas, and becoming someone who
          can contribute, lead, and create with purpose.

        <h3>My Greatest Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          My greatest inspiration has always been my mother. She’s the person who shaped my values and taught me what
          discipline, responsibility, and strength truly look like. Growing up, I watched her sacrifice so much so that
          my sisters and I could study, dream freely, and chase opportunities she wanted for herself. She taught me that
          independence is something you earn with courage and hard work.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
          More than anything, she has always been my best friend and my source of guidance. She showed me that
          success isn’t just about achieving goals, but about living with integrity, empathy, and purpose. Every bit of
          confidence or calmness I carry today comes from her, and I hope to become even a fraction of the strong,
          thoughtful woman she is.
