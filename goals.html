                kind of engineer, leader, and person I want to be. These goals represent my long-term direction,
                purpose, and the future I’m working toward.</p>

                    <h3>Become a Full-Stack Software Engineer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Become confident in modern full-stack technologies, including React, .NET/Node.js, and cloud
                        platforms. My goal is to build scalable and user-focused applications that strengthen my
                        technical foundation and prepare me for real-world software engineering challenges. My goal is
                        to eventually design real applications that help people, not just projects
                        that exist inside my laptop.

                    <h3>Deepen AI & ML Expertise</h3>
                    <p>
                        Continue learning advanced AI and machine learning concepts through hands-on projects,
                        experimentation, and real data-driven applications. This will help me gain a deeper
                        understanding of how intelligent systems are built and how they can be used to solve modern
                        problems. I want to explore AI and Machine Learning not just as buzzwords, but as tools
                        for solving real challenges—from healthcare, security, human-computer interaction, and more.

                    <p>
                        My long-term purpose in Computer Science is to use technology in a way that improves lives.
                        Whether that’s through smart systems, data-driven insights, or automation, I want my work to
                        have a positive impact and serve a purpose bigger than just writing code.

                        Beyond just technical growth, I want to stay curious, keep learning, and continue building
                        confidence in who I’m becoming as a young woman in tech. I want to lead, communicate well,
                        believe in myself, and stay passionate about creating the future I dream of.
